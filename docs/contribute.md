## Contribute to the STILT model

STILT would not be possible without the strong community of developers behind it. This distribution contains a completely redesigned STILT wrapper and proposes a centralized, collaborative platform for documentation and future development.

Model development in the form of feature enhancements, documentation updates, bug fixes, or simple suggestions from the community are welcome.
